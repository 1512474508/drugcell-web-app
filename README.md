This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Data Resources

The web-app requires a structured collection of JSON documents that represent the DrugCell Data. These are generated from DrugCell CX networks which are generated by DrugCell analysis.

### Downloading CX Data

DrugCell networks should be organized in a single set on an NDEx server, accessible by a set UUID. The JSON summary of a network set is accessible via the following path:

`http://public.ndexbio.org/v2/networkset/{setUUID}?accesskey={accessKey}` 

The accessKey is an optional sharing parameter if the network set is not public. This JSON summary can be saved in a file and used as input for the downloading script below:

`./bin/download-networks.js http://public.ndexbio.org ./data/drug-cell-network-set.json ./data/networks/`

This will download all of the networks into the `./data/networks/` directory. These networks must be pre-processed to identify individual paths in the network. The script for pre-processing is below:

`./bin/build-indexes-and-paths.js ./data/networks/ ./data/public/data/drugs/`

Note that the `./data/public/data/drugs/` directory must exist and be empty for this script to work.

Individual paths can be extracted from a single CX file using the following script:

`./bin/build-data.js ./data/drugcell_example_network.cx ./data/public/data/drugs/`

Once the paths are generated, a final index of all drugs must be generated:

`./bin/build-drug-index.js ./data/public/data/ ./data/public/data/drugs`


## Running and Building DrugCell Oracle

With the data directories filled with pre-computed paths and indexes, you can run the DrugCell Oracle web-app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

This app can be deployed, and is configured to use its own `public/data` directory to serve pre-computed paths and indexes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
